 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "Bruma Tristiae"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In Brittania, there is a saying: 'The poorer fellow will live another day'. For the Celtic tribes, this is certainly true. Trampled by romans for close to two thousand years, subjugated by Vikings for a millennium, the Celtic people have developed a strong culture of resistance. To the South, Roman Legions plot to march north to perform their final conquest of Brittania; To the north, the Vikings seek to bring the Scots and Hibernians into the Norse fold, and sandwiched between them ae the Celts. Having long waited, they are ready to strike, but will they work as one, or will they tear each other apart?"
 BRT_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Brittania Romania has been present in some form or another for close to two millennia, and with good reason. Straddling the wire between the Roman elite and the disgruntled Celtic majority, it has always been a tight balancing act, but throughout, the Romans in Britainnia have carved a niche for themselves as the liaison between the Isles and the Roman world. However, with recent advances in technology, many are starting to question if legionaries need to stay on the isle of Albion..."
 HIL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The land of Hibernia to many seems distant and wild. Indeed, the only Roman influence comes from the Second Legion, positioned in the South. However, it seems the Romans may have bitten off more than they could chew with this one. Numerous Hibernian tribes have split from the dominion of the Legion and formed a free federation, promising to shatter Roman Imperialism and bring a new dawn to the Celtic World, by the ink of the pen, or by the steel of the sword..."
 RVK_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Mountains of Scotiae had long been a challenge to any invading force. Rome had to seal it off with a wall of stone, but the Vikings had no qualms about it. Slowly expanding from their hold on Orknejar, they pushed into the mainland of Brittania, incorporating the tribes of Alba as a loyal Dominion. Blending Norse and Celtic culture into something unique, they reformed into the Riki Vikingonna, and set their eyes southwards, expanding the dominion of their loyal subject. Now, they seek to expand deeper into Alba..."
 DRU_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "To an ouside observer, the snow-capped mountains of Ynys Mon would be no place to forge an empire, yet one stands there. The druidic cults of Cambria sought freedom from the tribes of that nation, and so split away to form a theocracy on the isle of Ynys Mon. There, they culticated their ways of life before pushing outwards in all directions, back into Cambria, North to Mannia, and West to Hibernia. However, all is not calm. A new Christian movement thretens to dissolve the ancienst standing stones, and the Cambrian tribes eye the druids lands enviously..."
 PIC_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Picts are a loose federation of Celts from beyond the wall of Hadrian. Long entrenched in their liberty from empires that would dominate them, and a constant trade towards them, their government has developed into an economic and interventionist-focused one. However, their organisation has fallen to the wayside; with increasing economic isolation and military threats from the Vikings and Alba, it seems the Picts will have to lash out to secure their lucrative networks at the edge of Brittania..."
 ICI_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Iceni are as ancient as they come, the leaders of the first Brittanian rebellion and a symbol of Anti-Imperialism in Brittaia. Led by the self-claimed 'Empress' Boudicca V, she constantly rails against the Romans in Britain, promising to destroy them in their entirety by forming an alliance unlike any seen before. The romans (and some tribes) scoff at her claims, but the threat is real, if enough agree to it, and assuming the Anglo-Saxon Diaspora, led by Aethelweald Aethling, doesn't become too rebellious themselves..."
 SIL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "Proud, Strong, and Liberated: That's how the silures would describe themselves. Together as one tribe they shattered the Druids' rule over them, bringing freedom to the valleys of Cambria, and the bountiful resources they contained within them. Now, the High Queen, Ceridwen, must decide on the future of the nation. Will they return to the fold of the Druids with new autonomy, seek a pact with the Romans, or go their own, unique way?"
 DMN_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "In the rocky corner of the lands of Brittania lies the sole Christian tribe of Brittania: The Dumnonii. Led by the Pendracwn family, Proud and alone, they seek to liberate the Britons in their fellow nations from the tyranny of absolute monarchism and theocracy. While the Romans see them as a disposable ally at the moment, the Britons seek to turn the tables, and make the small peninsula indespensable to the Romans. In this way, he has becun to create his new palace of Camlynn, where his loyal subjects stand prepared for whatever the future throws at the young King Arthur."
